# Introduction

The following short presentation illustrates how to use open science tools in empirical accounting research.

- A replication of a table by @P_2013.

- Original based on data for the period 1965 to 1995

- Replication uses data for the period 1996 to 2015.

- Replication follows the research design by @P_2013 as much as possible with the data at hand.


# Original Table

- The original table by @P_2013 relates current P/B ratios to current and future residual income.

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| output: asis

print(prep_latex_table_presentation(
    results['penman_table'],
    caption='Original table Penman 2013 - P/B Ratios And Future Residual Income',
    label='tab:original_penman'
))
```


# Replicated Table

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| output: asis

print(prep_latex_table_presentation(
    results['replication_results'],
    caption='Replicated table - P/B Ratios And Future Residual Income',
    label='tab:replicated'
))
```


# Data

Two files that comprise data from Worldscope. 

- The first file focuses on static information at the company level (items: ISIN, company name and country where the company is domiciled)

- The second file contains panel data at the company-year level (items: ISIN, year, market value of equity, book value of equity and net income).


# Research Design Choices


Following @P_2013, we focus our analysis on companies that are domiciled in the United States. 

In addition, we impose the following requirements:

- We require both the market value of equity (i.e., the numerator of the P/B ratio) and the book value of equity (i.e., the denominator of the P/B ratio) to be positive because non-positive P/B ratios are not economically meaningful. 

- We focus the analysis on the period 1996 to 2015 (as required in the task sheet).

- In computing the residual income, we assume a constant cost of equity of 10% (for simplicity).
Other than that, we follow @P_2013 by 

- computing the residual income for the current year (year 0) and the subsequent six years (year 1 to 6),

- assigning each company-year to one of 20 groups based on the P/B ratio (e.g., the first group includes company-years with the highest 5% of P/B ratios, while the bottom group includes those with the lowest 5%),

- computing and tabulating median statistics on the P/B ratio and current as well as future residual income for each P/B group.


# Results

The replicated table shows some 

- Similarities with the original table by @P_2013 in that median residual income for years 1 and 2 (a) is highest for the group of company-years with the highest P/B ratios and (b) decreases monotonically by P/B group.

- These findings are in line with valuation theory that predicts higher P/B ratios for companies that are expected to generate higher future residual income.

- However, the patterns are less clear for years 3 to 6 in the replicated table (in particular for the group with the highest P/B ratios), which stands in contrast to @P_2013.

# Conclusion

- A replication of a table that relates current P/B ratios to current and future residual income.

- The original table by @P_2013 uses data for the period 1965 to 1995. In contrast, the replication focuses on the period 1996 to 2015.

- The replication yields mixed results.

- While the relation between current P/B ratios and residual income in the near future is similar to that presented in the original table, residual income patterns in the more distant future cannot be replicated.
